Address Book 

Implemented in PHP with PDO
Materialize front end


USER STORIES
I can add a new contact
I can view a list of my contact names, and click each one to see their record
I can click a field on the contact record when open and change it 
I can delete a contact record when it is open (and am sent back to the main page)
I can filter contacts by name: first name, last name, or "contains"
